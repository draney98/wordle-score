    Perform a full end-of-project cleanup on this codebase. Before making any change, check whether the step is already complete; if it is, skip it. Only modify the code when it improves clarity, correctness, maintainability, or test coverage. Do not make cosmetic or unnecessary changes. Execute the steps in this order:

0. 

    1. Refactor for clarity and maintainability: simplify logic, remove duplication, and standardize naming. Skip if the code already follows good structure.

    2. Remove unused code: eliminate dead functions, imports, variables, or unreachable paths, but only if they are confirmed unused.

    3. Apply linting/style rules: fix violations only when doing so adds real value; avoid noise-only diffs.

    4. Add or improve docstrings and comments explaining intent. Skip parts that are already well documented.

    5. Generate or update unit tests for public functions, but only where coverage is missing.

    6. Add or refine integration tests for key workflows, adding only what’s necessary.

    7. Review error handling and improve it only if real gaps exist.

    8. Update README/API documentation to match current behavior, skipping sections that are already accurate.

    9. Audit dependencies: remove unused ones and propose upgrades only when safe and beneficial.

    10. Perform a lightweight security review and fix only genuine issues.

    11. Prepare release materials (CHANGELOG, release notes, version bump) based on any actual changes made.

    Validate deployment configuration and ensure the project builds cleanly.
